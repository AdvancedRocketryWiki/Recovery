# Recovery

**This is not a guide to recovering rockets, simply a basic revist of the concepts**

Recovery is an essential piece of Rocketry for three main reasons: You want the rocket back, you don't want to obliterate the Rocket, and you don't want to hit somebody with a 
fast moving projectile.

There are two main Recovery types that are generally used in Rocketry:
- Parachutes
- Streamers

Each has its strengths and weakness as we will explore below



### Parachutes

Parachutes are the most common and sterotypical method of recovery for rockets.
As the rocket reaches or after apogee the parachute shot out the front of the rocket, and due to the movement air will (Hopefully!) unfurl and lead to a smooth descent of your rocket

However, as many recovery system do, Parachutes require generally a pyrotechinic or mechanical to eject the chute out of the rockets body.
In addition, there is a art of knowing when to deploy your chute; to high and the rocket will drift into the next county, to low and it will smash into a jillion pieces.

Parachutes are generally made from a plastic on the lower scale, but larger ones are made generally of ripstop nylon with cords that connect to a connection point where one
would connect to generally the nose cone and/or shock cord

### Streamers

Simular to chutes, Streamers are another pretty common method to recovery generally smaller, lightweight rockets.

They deploy in the same manner as parachutes and are connected in the same fashion. Unlike chutes, streamers are elongated ribbons that create enough drag to not destroy the rocket
Streamers are helpful as they will slow the descent rate but not keep the rocket in the air forever.

#### Other Recovery Types
There are tons of other ways to recover rockets
- Glider - gliding the rocket back to the ground (+1 cool points)
- Helicopter - Using rotating blades to slow the descent of the rocket
- Tumble - Making a rocket purposely unstable so after powered flight in creates a tumbling motion and thus slows down (only really applicable to small rockets)
- Featherweight - The rocket is so light in falls at a slow rate (only really applicable to small rockets)

## Parachute Protection

Generally most ejection systems use pyrotechnics, a black powder charge or a built-in function of the motor and thus produce a wave of hot flamey gases.
Thus it is required to protect a parachute so it does not get burned, melted, etc.

For smaller rockets a common method is to use wadding or what some fondly call, "Dog Barf".
Wadding's objective is to dampen the flame and heat by sacrificing themselves, but still keeping the force so the chute is ejected. Thus you must have a good idea of
the wadding required so that your rocket does not burn its chute, nor not eject it.

For larger rockets their are multiple options for reusable cloths than can protect the chute from the flame, a common method used in High Power & Mid-Power Rocketry.
Another option are baffles, which are a clever trick of swirling the gases to dampen the ejection charge.

### Shock Cord Protection

Simular to chutes, shock cords can be burned as well - they are generally the cloth mentionded earlier, just made to make a sleeve for the cord. Only really needed for large rockets with big boi charges.

## Mechnical Ejection

uh put some of your dark mechnical magic here ig


## Pistons

im not rly a expert on pistons, so somebody else should prob doit
